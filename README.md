# Land-Down-Under Write-up

Description : 
"Yeeeeeeah Mate, Fair Dinkum that there Straya' speak, flamin' good luck mate. Some drongo was so smashed he wrote it upside down, it'll be right true blue if you could figure out what that drunk C*** did with our flag"
"Yeah nah nah yeah nah its straight fark'd, more crooked then a boomerang mate."


At first I found the text upside down, I searched for a tool that can return the original text, and after a long search I found this tool (https://www.upsidedowntext.com/)


After looking at length, I found that this was not plain text, but text, and I started searching for this text, and found out that it was Aussie++

I found a great page explaining about this language (https://aussieplusplus.vercel.app/) but there are a lot of errors in the code, I modified it and fixed the error after that I ran the code but there is no flag

After reading about this language, I found that a call to Variable must be written to extract the flag, after tracing in the code I found that (a_hiccup) is the flag

I actually found it
